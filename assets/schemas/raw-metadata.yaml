title: "Raw metadata"
description: |
  A critical part of our GWAS sumstats cleaning pipeline is accurate meta-data
  for each study.  This meta-data gives critical input to the cleaning pipeline,
  allows us to annotate and organize studies, and collects information that is
  critical for down stream uses of the cleaned sum stats.

  It is critical the information is filled out accurately and completely.  There
  are some automated checks, but it is not possible to computationally validate all
  pieces of info, so please fill out with care!

  In addition to this meta data, we need the actual sum stats file, any associated
  readme files, and a pdf of the publication (and potentially relevant supplementary
  information as well).

  The template generator tool assists this process by providing a 'blank' metadata
  for the study you are interested in.  It will check our in house library to see if the
  stats have already been processed to save time, and stamp this template with version
  and date.

  Two resources are/may be necessary to assist in the completiong of this data:
  Our in house ontologies which provides standard codes for certain variables.

  An external data base that can be referenced to save some time:

      the requirements (`library`) of being used as a library file.

      Both kinds of metadata files can be run in the pipeline, the
      difference is that a library file also contains metadata about the study
      that the sumstats file originated from. This extra metadata is not used by
      the pipeline, it's only used for organizing metadata files.

      In that case, it is likely the SE of the ln(OR) and should be reported in the col_SE.

      Check carefully.

  col_Z:
    title: "Hypothesis test statistic (e.g., Z, Wald, t)"
    description: |
      Column for the Z-score, also called "wild", "t-statistic" or "stat".
    type: "string"

  col_P:
    title: "P-value"
    description: |
      Column for the P-value.
    type: "string"

  stats_neglog10P:
    title: "Is p-value -log10 transformed?"
    type: "boolean"

  col_N:
    title: "Per SNP total sample size"
    description: |
      Column for the per variant number of individuals. Sometimes referred to as number non-missing.
    type: "string"

  col_CaseN:
    title: "Per SNP case sample size"
    description: |
      Column for the number of used individuals as cases for this variant.
    type: "string"

  col_ControlN:
    title: "Per SNP control sample size"
    description: |
      Column for the number of used individuals as controls for this variant.
    type: "string"

  col_StudyN:
    title: "Per SNP number of metastudies"
    description: |
      Column for the per variant number of how many metastudies that were used.
    type: "string"

  col_INFO:
    title: "Imputation quality score"
    description: |
      Column for the specific info-score for this variant. INFO scores reflect imputation quality.
      Do not use 'minimum INFO' for meta-analysis.

      Include only if it reflects the INFO for all data points
      (for a meta, this could be an INFO score derived post hoc from individual study INFO scores.)
    type: "string"

  col_EAF:

    description: |
      Description needed
    type: "string"

  col_OAF:
    title: "OA frequency in the GWAS cohorts"
    description: |
      Description needed
    type: "string"

  col_Direction:
    title: "Cohort effect directions"
    description: |
      Column that describes effects across contributing studies to meta-analyses.

      It often looks like a series of +, -, or ? (e.g., +-++---? )
    type: "string"

  col_Notes:
    title: "Special considerations and notes"
    description: |
      If there are special notes that you feel need to be included, please add them here.
      If preprocessing was require due to a really strange format, describe the issue and
      required preprocessing here. You could provide a link to a preprocessing code file.

      ***USE CARE*** Please note if the A1 was FORCED to be effect allele because of bad documentation.
