    description: |
      TBD
    type: "integer"
    minimum: 0

  cleansumstats_col_CHR:
    description: |
      Column where the chromosome information is in.

      It is OK if it comes embedded in a joined position vector like 1:2444, 1_1244 or 1_234:a:t.

      An internal algorithm will split out the correct value.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_POS:
    description: |
      Column where the base pair positions is in.

      It is OK if it comes embedded in a joined position vector like 1:2444, 1_1244 or 1_234:a:t.

      An internal algorithm will split out the correct value.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_SNP:
    description: |
      Column for the RSID identifiers if available, otherwise the column for the unique SNP identifier.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_EffectAllele:
    description: |
      Column for the effect allele.

      It is OK if it comes embedded in a joined position vector like 1_234:a:t.

      An internal algorithm will split out the correct value. Do NOT assume A1=EffectAllele.
      Check carefully.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_OtherAllele:
    description: |
      Column for the non effect allele.

      It is OK if it comes embedded in a joined position vector like 1_234:a:t.

      An internal algorithm will split out the correct value. Do NOT assume A1=EffectAllele.

      Check carefully.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_BETA:
    description: |
      Column for the beta estimate (per allele effect).

      Can be an ln(OR) for case control trait or linear coefficient.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_SE:
    description: |
      Column for the standard error of the beta column.

      Sometimes an SE is given with an OR - this is typically on the ln(OR) scale, and should be reported here.

      Check carefully.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_OR:
    description: |
      Column for the odds ratio.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_ORL95:
    description: |
      Column for the odds ratio lower 95th percentile of confidence interval.

      May not be present - will be missing for linear models, or an SE may be provide with an OR.
      In that case, it is likely the SE of the ln(OR) and should be reported in the cleansumstats_col_SE.

      Check carefully.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_ORU95:
    description: |
      Column for the odds ratio upper 95th percentile of confidence interval.

      May not be present - will be missing for linear models, or an SE may be provide with an OR.
      In that case, it is likely the SE of the ln(OR) and should be reported in the cleansumstats_col_SE.

      Check carefully.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_Z:
    description: |
      Column for the Z-score, also called "wild", "t-statistic" or "stat".
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_P:
    description: |
      Column for the P-value.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_N:
    description: |
      Column for the per variant number of individuals. Sometimes referred to as number non-missing.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_CaseN:
    description: |
      Column for the number of used individuals as cases for this variant.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_ControlN:
    description: |
      Column for the number of used individuals as controls for this variant.
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_INFO:
    description: |
      Column for the specific info-score for this variant. INFO scores reflect imputation quality.
      Do not use 'minimum INFO' for meta-analysis.

      Include only if it reflects the INFO for all data points
      (for a meta, this could be an INFO score derived post hoc from individual study INFO scores.)
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_EAF:

      Description needed
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_OAF:

      Description needed
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_Direction:
    description: |
      Column that describes effects across contributing studies to meta-analyses.

      It often looks like a series of +, -, or ? (e.g., +-++---? )
    type: "string"

  cleansumstats_col_Notes:
    description: |
      If there are special notes that you feel need to be included, please add them here.
      If preprocessing was require due to a really strange format, describe the issue and
      required preprocessing here. You could provide a link to a preprocessing code file.

      ***USE CARE*** Please note if the A1 was FORCED to be effect allele because of bad documentation.
